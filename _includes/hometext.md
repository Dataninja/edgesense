[CATALYST](http://catalyst-fp7.eu/) brings together deeply experienced community-partners and academic research partners to deliver an ecosystem of Collective Intelligence services that will augment partnersâ€™ platforms with Web-based Annotation tools; Recommenders to help users prioritise attention; Online creativity triggers; Interactive Visualizations, and Social Network and Deliberation Analytics.

In the context of the CATALYST project, [Wikitalia](http://www.wikitalia.it) is involved in an effort to build Edgesense, an easy-to-install social network analysis software for common CMSs (we'll start by targeting Drupal.) 

We know online communities have interesting properties, but through this tool we'll try to help community managers to answer the question: [how much can we control them?](http://www.cottica.net/2014/02/12/farming-online-conversations-assessing-moderators-impact-with-panel-data-econometrics/)

The tool will provide insights to [help the community manager get a sense of what is happening in the community](/online_conversations_as_networks.html).

Stay tuned for more!
