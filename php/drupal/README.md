## Setup

The module uses the private drupal filesystem which has to be configured for the module to work properly. 

The module will dump a script run configuration file in the directory <drupal private dir>/edgesense/script. You will need to protect this directory if you are going to setup a set of source URLs for the data that require a password, as the password will be written to that file.
